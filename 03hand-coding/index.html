            <li>Experiment with Texture & Color – Mix fabrics and don’t shy away from prints or bold tones.</li>
            <li>Add Shape with Belts – Define your waist with belts over dresses or tunics.</li>
            <li>Use Statement Accessories – Elevate simple outfits with scarves, jewelry, or bags.</li>
            <li>Go Long with Style – Choose maxi skirts or dresses with fun details like pleats or tiers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shopping Sustainably</h2>
        <p>Shopping sustainably means making mindful choices that benefit both the planet and the people behind our
            clothes. You can start by thrifting, shopping secondhand online, or supporting small and ethical brands that
            use eco-friendly materials. Buying fewer, better-quality pieces and taking care of what you own can make a
            big difference. Look for timeless styles, learn to read fabric labels, and try swapping or borrowing instead
            of always buying new. You can even make your own, by sewing, crochetting or even Knitting your own
            garnments! Sustainable fashion is all about being intentional — not perfect — and making choices
            that align with your values and personal style.</p>
