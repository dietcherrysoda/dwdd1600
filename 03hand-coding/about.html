        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>As someone who loves fashion and values <EM>modesty</EM>, I started this website to create a space where the two could
            come together in a way that feels authentic, stylish, and true to who I am. I'm passionate about helping
            others feel confident in their personal style while also being mindful of where and how our clothes are
            made.</p>
